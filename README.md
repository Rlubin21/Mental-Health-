# Mental-Health-

During my tenure on a dynamic team of four, we tackled the pressing issue of mental health among students. In this collaborative effort, my primary responsibility revolved around crafting impactful data visualizations integral to our project's success.

One significant finding I contributed was uncovering that a substantial 68.9% of students grappled with moderate to severe stress levels. Notably, 55% of these individuals fell within the critical age bracket of 18-20 years old. This insight underscored the urgency of our mission and guided our strategic initiatives to better support this demographic's mental well-being.
